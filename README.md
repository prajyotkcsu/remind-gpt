# RemindGPT

## Overview
RemindGPT is a simple yet effective task management tool designed to help you stay organized and focused throughout your day. Its core functionality revolves around parsing your wishlist using OpenAI API (prompt engineering) and coming up with a tailored list of task. These tasks are cheery picked from across different categorites. Right now, ethe app supports five major categories of tasks. They are enum values: Fitness, Social, Self-Development, Responsibilities, and Work.

## Features
- **Smart Task Reminders**: Rather than overwhelming you with a list of all remaining tasks, RemindGPT intelligently considers the time you have before your break. It prompts you to input the available time, and then suggests tasks that can be achieved within that timeframe.

- **Personalized Assistance**: Think of RemindGPT as your friend. It assists you in making the most out of your break time by recommending tasks that align with the time you have available.

## Procedure to use the app
1) Send request to the app
   '
   localhost:8084/reminder/api/task/produce
   '

These tasks are partitioned as they get introduced to Kafka broker
The partitions are stored against task types inside Redis, to download redis image use 
```
$ docker run --name some-redis -d redis
```

   
5) Further, upon receiving this as a response from the AI, app sends the curation to the Kafka server, and appends partitions with values. Here, Kafka has a topic: "assist-topic", with 5 partitions each dedicated for five separate categories of tasks.
6) Until now Kafka producer is doing its part. As soon as user takes a break, an API triggers the application at localhost:8084/tasks
7) The application now fetches List<Tasks> from the Kafka topic. It constructs the list as list of tasks from each partition/category based on the break duration. Say calling a friend would need 10 min+ taking a walk would require 5 min and both can be done together. These kind of logic are built using OpenAI API. The core of this project is storing key value in Kafka, and logically presenting tasks from each partition and adjusting the offset pointer.

## Next up
In time for OpenAIâ€™s grand opening of the hashtag#GPTStore, we are excited to launch the Ask Instacart GPT, a successor to our ChatGPT Plugin introduced back in May. Far more advanced than its predecessor, the new Instacart GPT leverages every advantage of chatgpt multimodality to talk and see. Now you can Ask Instacart what to make for dinner through text, voice, or by snapping a picture of your fridge or a cookbook recipe. With just a few simple clicks, you can have all the ingredients delivered to your door as fast as within an hour. Give it a try and let us know what you think!
